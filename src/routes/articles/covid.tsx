            <p>
                We are not going to be requiring masks, proof of vaccination, or
                proof of a negative test but we do want to remind everyone of
                some good basic practices:
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We recognize that Covid-19 cases are starting to raise in our
                communities. We also understand that mitigating all risk of
                exposure to Covid-19 is impossible, and participants should make
                responsible decisions based on their own risk assessment and
                comfort. That said if participants are more comfortable wearing
                a mask during the event they should and will not be asked to
                remove for any reason.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                In the event someone develops symptoms:
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                Anyone who develops symptoms between event days is asked not to
                return or enter the event.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adults will be asked to leave the venue if they develop
                symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Students who develop symptoms should notify their mentor
                immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mentors should have a plan to arrange for pickup of the sick
                student by a parent or other adult.
            </li>
            <li>
                An adult should stay with the student outdoors, away from others
                while awaiting pickup.
            </li>
            <li>All attendees must stay home if they feel sick.</li>

# HTML Basics :3

HTML is the fundamental skelaton for making web pages :3

## Headings

headings are represented with `<h1>` all the way to `<h6>`. For example:

```html
<h1>one heading :3</h1>
<h2>Another Heading :3</h2>
<h3>this is also another heading</h3>
<h6>the other heading :3</h6>
```

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are used to write sentences for your web page using `<p>`. Some examples are:

```html
<p>this is a paragraph. Also, ice cream truck music is cool :3</p>
```

## Images :3

Adding images helps to keep readers engaged in the web page. Use `<img>` to define the image and `src` to insert the image.

Example:

```html
<img
    src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1285568746/sv/vektor/traffic-cone-ikonen-isolera-p%C3%A5-vit-bakgrund.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=JH2uSRo60TZGCc8_JzdxsL3AFQh8MHJKWN1v8AHKiSI=" />
```

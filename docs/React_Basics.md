# REACT BASICS!!!

## So what is React?

React is a library for JavaScript! Libraries in coding are a bunch of pre-written functions and tools you can use to make development easier. So how does React make web development greater than it already is?

## The Benefits!

So React has a way better way to structure your code for websites because it lets you have your HTML and JavaScript in one place!

With how React is structured, you can make these very diverse HTML-JavaScript fusion code that looks like this!

```jsx
import React from 'react'; //Imports the React Library so you can use it

function codeFusion() {
    const text = 'JavaScript in an HTML tag!'
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>WOAH, HTML IN A REACT FUNCTION/COMPONENT!!!</h1>
            <p>And, {text}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
```

React Functions/Components return HTML code! Make sure it is all in one div tag or else you'll get an error for not being contained in one space (dun dUN DUN). Another cool feature is you can then reference JavaScript code within the HTML using the legendary {}, (CURLY BRACKETS)!

<div style="font-size: 2em">ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE!!!/div>

Well, that is pretty much the basics of it, with your knowledge of JavaScript and HTML + the next lessons where you learn Components, Functions, and State, you will now be unstoppable in the React world!

# Functions and Components

## Basics of Functions

What makes React special is that it's so easy to make it **react**ive! One way we do this is with **functions**. They work in the same way that Java (robot code, if you have experience with that) work: functions may take in a condition, and complete a certain action.

Functions are used to handle events

We use functions to modify things on a page based on user input (or other variable like time)

One example of a

(to use in multiple places, use a component for that)

good function example - button?
why do we need that in socal showdown?

## **what IS a functional component?**

reminder - look @ other peoples' documentation!

as opposed to class components...

functional components allow you to pass in arguments

why?

to use over and over again in multiple places (Multibuttons, for example)
allow you to customize the functionality of your app

main points

(take from manual, too)

they'll already know....

-   git
-   html
-   javascript
-   jsx
-   running the app

need to cover:

-   structure of functions - pieces
-   where/why/how to use
-   how we use it (buttons, number inputs, conditional rendering, etc)
-   state? (no, Crisanto)
    functions w/o understanding state?

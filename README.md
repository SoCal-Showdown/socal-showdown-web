Both of the following tools can be run at once using `npm run fix`. Both are
also applied before commits.

### ESLint

> ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in
> ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and
> avoiding bugs.

Run the command `npm run lint` to detect issues and fix any auto-fixable ones.

### Prettier

> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It removes all original styling
> and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

Run the command `npm run format` to format all code.

# Hello Content v2

This page corresponds to the `posts/` route of your website. You can delete it or create another file in the `content/posts/` directory.

Try navigating to one of the existing announcements from here:

- [Applications Posted](/posts/announcements/applications-posted)

We use a generic `[...slug].vue` page to generate files for any blog posts added to the website. This way, we just need to create
links to all the pages, and the pages themselves are automatically made for us!
